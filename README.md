# 11-Express.js-Note-Taker

## Description
This project is to test how well I can apply Epress.js. In doing so, I am utilizing Express.js to create a note taker where users can add, save, and delete notes with a title name. I have learned that I need to pay special attention to paths and where everything is coming from. 

## Installation
NA

## Usage
To add a note, click the button from the html page to take you to the notes page. Add your title and text within the designated fields and click on the save button. Your just added notes will be displayed on the left column with the other existing notes. If you click on an existing note, that note will appear in the right column.
